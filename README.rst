======================================

CozyGit is a package of git command to help with git's workflow for cozy


The Interface
-------------

``update [<branch>]`` 
    Pull the changes of the branch from the server. By default it executes on current branch ::
    
    $ git checkout development
    $ git pull --no-ff
    $ git checkout <branch>

``mergemaster <branch>``
    Merge the branch in master ::
    
    $ git checkout master
    $ git merge --no-ff <branch>
    $ git checkout <branch>

``devmerge``
    Update dev and merge it in current branch //STILL IN DEVELOPMENT// ::

    $ git checkout development
    $ git pull --no-ff
    $ git checkout feature/1stFeature
    $ git merge -–no-ff development

``mergeclose``
    Merge current branch in dev and close it ::

    $ git checkout development
    $ git merge -–no-ff <current branch>
    $ git branch –d <current branch>

``newbranch <branch>``
    Create a new branch, push it to the server and link both branches ::

    $ git checkout -b <branch>
    $ git push origin <branch>
    $ git branch --set-upstream <branch> origin/<branch>

    Stash, Fetch, Auto-Merge/Rebase, Push, and Unstash.
    You can only sync published branches.

    Switches to specified branch.
    Defaults to current branch.
    Automatically stashes and unstashes any changes.

    Swiches to it immediately.
